# OpenLayers + Vite + Bootstrap 5

This application is developed with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

To get started, run the following (requires Node 14+):


Then change into your new `gis-portal` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:8080):

    cd gis-portal
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
